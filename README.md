# Employee_Profile_Generator

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation for this project was to further learn about express.js and how to make a larger file that includes several files and folders.
- I built this project to further my skills in express.js
- This solves a problem of making an htlm file through express.js and node.js
- I learned that the smaller each file is, the easier it will run

## Installation

When the terminal is open, be sure to 'npm i' to install any dependencies

## Usage

Open the terminal and node start. The manager prompt will first prompt the manager for their information then proceed to instruct the user if new employees information needs to be added.
